# Sorting Algorithms Overview

This document provides an overview of various sorting algorithms, their mechanisms, and their time complexities.

## Sorting Algorithms

### 1. Bubble Sort

- **Mechanism**: Compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Best Case: `O(n)` (already sorted)
  - Average Case: `O(n^2)`
  - Worst Case: `O(n^2)`
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` (in-place)
